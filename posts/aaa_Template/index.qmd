This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!

![](thumbnail.jpg)

Okay, so all I have to do is add text here and it'll just show up in the blog. Lets try showing some code:

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(TannersTools)
library(scales)

```

```{r}

fidr <- tt_import_fid_R()

fidr %>% 
  filter(fund == 11) %>% 
  group_by(FY) %>% 
  summarise(amount = sum(amount) / 1000000000) %>% 
  tt_inf_deflate(amount, FY, 2022, deflator = "SLIPD") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(FY, amount.SLIPD.2022)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +
  labs(title = "Real General Fund Revenue",
       subtitle = "Billions",
       x = "",
       y = "") +
  theme_classic()
```
